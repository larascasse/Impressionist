{"name":"impressionist","body":"### Hey there!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out impressionist. impressionist is a visual tool that enables you to create impress.js presentations in a visual, easy to use way.Impressionist is conceptualized and developed by Harish Sivaramakrishnan and is under open development on github. Please feel free to watch / fork / log issues.\r\n\r\n### Why did I build impressionist?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nImpress.js expects you to have a reasonably good knowledge of programming with HTML and CSS to make presentations that look good. If you don't do HTML/CSS, impress.js is not for you. Impressionist is an effort to change that. Impressionist has a user interface very similar to powerpoint / keynote which will reduce your learning curve. The orchestration lets you author gorgeous transitions for your presentations visually by leveraging the brilliant 3D/2D transforms that impress.js brings along.\r\n\r\nWriting presentations should be fun, and a visual tool can surely help!\r\n\r\n### Sounds good, can I start using it already?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYES. You can start using impressionist to build your presentations. However, it still has some distance to go before it becomes release quality. Expect to find bugs as you use it :) Impressionist is opensource under MIT license - Do help out fixing issues.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT: impressionist is currently supported on webkit based browsers (Chrome / Safari) only. Running this on Mozilla / Opera / IE will give you erratic results (or it may not work at all ;))**\r\n\r\n### Key features\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n* Visual slide authoring\r\n* Drag and drop positioning of slide elements\r\n* Supports Text and Images\r\n* Copy paste support for slide elements\r\n* Keyboard navigation for slide element repositioning\r\n* Gorgeous typography with google webfonts\r\n* Skew, Rotate and transforming of slide elements\r\n* Visual transition orchestrator\r\n* Change and preview\r\n* Download presentation as ZIP\r\n\r\n### Version History\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## 0.1\r\n* UI redesign\r\n* In place transform support\r\n* Bug fixes around CSS Matrix Transforms\r\n\r\n## Alpha 3\r\n* First public preview\r\n* Export to ZIP\r\n* Orchestration view pagination\r\n* CTRL+C / V support for slide elements\r\n* CTRL+D to delete slide elements\r\n* Bug fixes ;)\r\n\r\n### Who am I?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Harish Sivaramakrishnan (hsivaram on twitter) and I am web standards evangelist @adobe and I live in Bangalore, India.
